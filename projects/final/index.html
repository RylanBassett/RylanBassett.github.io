                <p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have been consistently disrupted by
                    outbreaks, regulations and quarantines. The gaming world has been impacted through its relationship
                    to the semiconductor industry.</p>
                <p>The hardware side of the gaming industry is seeing order delays because consumer electronics require
                    high-end semiconductors and supply is not yet meeting the demand spurred by the world staying home.
                    While use rates have risen on Steam, a popular PC gaming client, companies are struggling to fill
                    orders for new consoles and handhelds without semiconductors to put in their products. </p>
                <h3>Growth in consumer electronics</h3>
                <p>An independent database of Steam usage, SteamDB, collects concurrent user numbers several times a
                    month and provides the dataset on their website. According to this data, use rates started to grow
                    at a faster pace immediately following March 2020.
                    There were more users on Steam and in-game while the pandemic was beginning compared to the months
                    before COVID-19 dominated news cycles.

                <h3>Semiconductors supply chain</h3>
                <p>According to University of Maryland business school professor Suresh Acharya, the semiconductor
                    supply chain has for many years been focused on efficiency over resilience. </p>
                <p>Efficient supply chains with single, highly specialized suppliers, make sense to companies when all
                    of the moving parts are moving together. The pandemic forced many of those parts to a screeching
                    halt, which resulted in collapse in supply chains that could not adapt to the changes. The
                    semiconductor industry is especially slow to adapt due to the high upfront investment needed to
                    create new manufacturing plants, or foundries. </p>
                <p>“Companies had started to rely just heavily excessively exclusively on single suppliers because
                    they're the best, they know what to do…” Acharya said. “But what happens when that one supplier goes
                    offline because of COVID – because of whatever? Now, the whole world comes crumbling down.”</p>
                <p>Acharya said the semiconductor industry relies on foundries, most of which are in Taiwan, for
                    assembly while most of the design of semiconductors is done by US companies like Nvidia and
                    Qualcomm. According to a 2020 report by the Congressional Research Service, over 60 percent of
                    revenue from fabless firms, companies that design but don’t fabricate semiconductors, are in the US.
                    In contrast, nearly three quarters of the revenue from foundries is in Taiwan. </p>

                <h3>The auto industry left an opportunity for electronics</h3>
                <p>Acharya described the origin of this semiconductor shortage, noting that discrepancies between supply
                    and demand are not uncommon in the industry. He said that the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic
                    caused a decrease in demand for consumer vehicles. So automakers stopped ordering semiconductors
                    from the foundries in Taiwan, since they were producing far less. Fewer people driving means fewer
                    cars, and fewer cars need fewer semiconductors.</p>
                <p>But the semiconductor foundries were left with the capacity to manufacture semiconductors, and that
                    capacity was soon filled by the electronics industry. According to Acharya, foundries adapted their
                    processes to create higher-end semiconductors for use in computers and game consoles. These
                    components are more complex than those used in most cars, so they are more expensive and make more
                    money for the foundries.</p>
                <p>Now that pandemic restrictions have loosened, automakers want to ramp up their production, but
                    foundries are incentivized to alot their capacity to the complex computer components.</p>
                <p>Acharya also said that the foundries are in no rush to fill the orders they do have for the consumer
                    electronics industry. There are very few manufacturers of quality semiconductors due to the highly
                    efficient and vulnerable supply chain, so the manufacturers have a captive demand.</p>
                <p>So computer and game companies are willing to wait for semiconductors just like game consumers are
                    willing to wait for consoles and game releases.</p>

                <h3>An anxious and captive demand</h3>
                <p>As of May 11, 2022, ordering a Steam Deck from Valve would get a unit to the customer sometime after
                    October, according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam</a> website.</p>
                <p>The Steam Deck, a handheld gaming device from Valve, released Feb. 25. It allows users to play mobile
                    or connect to a monitor, similar to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
                <p>One Reddit user, u/Fammy, took it upon themselves to build a <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/ui642q/introducing_deckbot/">Reddit bot</a> to
                    tell people how close they are to receiving their Steam Decks. To call the bot, which only works in
                    the original post and private messages after being rate limited by Reddit, users feed it the model
                    they ordered, their region and when they placed their order relative to pre-release opening. The bot
                    then spits out a percentage representing how close the user is to getting their device.</p>
                <p>Customers have been voicing their displeasure on social media as they wait months for their
                    pre-ordered units. Reddit user u/itsjustausername11 posted a <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/ujdb81/moment_of_silence_for_us_q2_secondhalfers/">meme</a>
                    about the long wait, featuring a very sad cat.</p>
