        <h1>Semiconductor shortage slows gaming industry</h1>
        <h2>Pandemic fueled tech demand is rushing past semiconductor manufacturing capacity.</h2>

                <p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have been consistently disrupted by
                    outbreaks, regulations and quarantines. The gaming world has been impacted through its relationship
                    to the semiconductor industry.</p>
                <p>The hardware side of the gaming industry is seeing order delays because consumer electronics require
                    high-end semiconductors and supply is not yet meeting the demand spurred by the world staying home.
                    While use rates have risen on Steam, a popular PC gaming client, companies are struggling to fill
                    orders for new consoles and handhelds without semiconductors to put in their products. </p>

                <h3>Growth in consumer electronics</h3>
                <p>An independent database of Steam usage, SteamDB, collects concurrent user numbers several times a
                    month and provides the dataset on their website. According to this data, use rates started to grow
                    at a faster pace immediately following March 2020.
                    There were more users on Steam and in-game while the pandemic was beginning compared to the months
                    before COVID-19 dominated news cycles.

                <h3>Semiconductors supply chain</h3>
                <p>According to University of Maryland business school professor Suresh Acharya, the semiconductor supply chain has for many years been focused on efficiency over resilience. </p>
                <p>Efficient supply chains with single, highly specialized suppliers, make sense to companies when all of the moving parts are moving together. The pandemic forced many of those parts to a screeching halt, which resulted in collapse in supply chains that could not adapt to the changes. The semiconductor industry is especially slow to adapt due to the high upfront investment needed to create new manufacturing plants, or foundries. </p>
                <p>“Companies had started to rely just heavily excessively exclusively on single suppliers because they're the best,  they know what to do…” Acharya said.  “But what happens when that one supplier goes offline because of COVID – because of whatever? Now, the whole world comes crumbling down.”</p>
                <p>Acharya said the semiconductor industry relies on foundries, most of which are in Taiwan, for assembly while most of the design of semiconductors is done by US companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm. According to a 2020 report by the Congressional Research Service, over 60 percent of revenue from fabless firms, companies that design but don’t fabricate semiconductors, are in the US. In contrast, nearly three quarters of the revenue from foundries is in Taiwan. </p>
