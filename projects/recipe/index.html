    <h1>Figs and Seared Duck Breast</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With a super easy preparation and just a few steps, you can enjoy a delectable duck entree with figs for a
        natural and filling meal.</p>
    <p>The hardest part will be scoring the skin with a sharp knife, which a child could handle, even if that'd be
        pretty irresponsible. You want to make sure not to pierce the <em>beautiful meaty flesh</em> during this step.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon's worth of zest</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tsp. rosemary leaves</li>
        <li>That one seems redundant</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. black ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 12-ounce duck breasts, patted dry and scored</li>
        <li>6 fresh figs, halved</li>
        <li>or, for the math wizzes, 12 half figs</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon worth of juice, save some wedges</li>
        <li>olive oil for a drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Prep</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl combine the lemon zest, garlic, and 1 tablespoon rosemary with sea salt and pepper. Mix well
            and rub the mixture all over both breasts.</li>
        <li>Place the duck skin-side down in a large, non-heated, ovenproof skillet. Place the skillet over medium heat
            and cook until the fat of the duck is rendered, and the skin is golden for 10 to 12 minutes. Pour out most
            of the fat from the skillet, save for later use.</li>
        <li>Flip the duck pieces over, remove the skillet from the heat, and scatter the figs and remaining 1 teaspoon
            rosemary all over the figs in the skillet but not on top of the duck.</li>
        <li>Place the skillet in the oven to roast for 5 minutes for medium.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the oven and turn on the broiler. Transfer the duck breasts to a cutting board,
            cover them with aluminum foil and let them rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet still containing the figs and place it under the broiler for about 1 to 2 minutes until
            the figs are lightly charred. Keep a keen eye on the figs as not to burn. (Not literally, as not to burn
            eye.)</li>
        <li>Slice the duck and serve with the figs on the side. Squeeze lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil all over
            the duck and the figs.</li>
